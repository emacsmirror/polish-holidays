* Description

This package adds Polish holidays to the Emacs calendar.

If you have ~org-agenda-include-diary~ set to ~t~,
these will be also listed in the ~org-agenda~ view.

** Installation

After loading the package, in your =init.el=
add a call to
#+begin_src elisp
(holiday-polish-holidays-set) ;; to enable Polish calendar and disable other calendars
#+end_src
or
add a call to
#+begin_src elisp
(holiday-polish-holidays-append) ;; to append Polish calendar to the current list of calendars
#+end_src

Note that this must be called *before* Emacs calendar is loaded.
